# John Rugh Portfolio

This portfolio was originally done in React with TailwindCSS and can be found here: [Original](https://github.com/roodhouse/newPortfolioHome). After learning Python I decided to recreate the portfolio using Python, Flask and Bootstrap5. I also fixed some bugs from the original along the way.
